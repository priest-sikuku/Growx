# Authentication & Navigation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **404 Errors on Button Clicks**
- **Problem**: Header buttons were using local state callbacks instead of proper navigation
- **Solution**: Updated Header component to use Next.js Link navigation and proper routing

### 2. **Direct Dashboard Access Without Authentication**
- **Problem**: Users could access dashboard without signing in
- **Solution**: Dashboard layout already had proper authentication checks via middleware

### 3. **Sign-up-success Page Serialization Error**
- **Problem**: Page was passing functions as props to Header component, causing build errors
- **Solution**: Removed function props and let Header manage its own authentication state

### 4. **Sign-in/Sign-up Pages Not Requiring Input**
- **Problem**: Pages had function props that weren't being used properly
- **Solution**: Simplified pages to remove unnecessary props and use proper form validation

## Changes Made

### Header Component (`components/header.tsx`)
- Added real authentication checking with `supabase.auth.getUser()`
- Implemented auth state subscription for real-time updates
- Changed buttons from state callbacks to proper Next.js Links
- Added proper sign-out functionality with database cleanup
- Removed `isLoggedIn` and `setIsLoggedIn` props

### Hero Component (`components/hero.tsx`)
- Added authentication checking on component mount
- Implemented auth state subscription
- Changed button navigation to use proper routes
- Removed `isLoggedIn` prop and manages state internally
- Buttons now navigate to `/auth/sign-up` when not logged in

### Auth Pages
- **sign-up/page.tsx**: Removed function props, kept form validation
- **sign-in/page.tsx**: Removed function props, kept form validation
- **sign-up-success/page.tsx**: Removed function props, simplified component

### Main Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Removed unnecessary `isLoggedIn` state management
- Simplified to just render Header, Hero, and Footer

## How Authentication Now Works

1. **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`): Checks user session on every request
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/sign-in` (except for home and auth pages)

2. **Dashboard Layout** (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`): Protects dashboard routes
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/sign-in`

3. **Header Component**: Checks real authentication status
   - Shows different navigation based on actual Supabase session
   - Provides proper sign-out functionality

4. **Auth Pages**: Require proper form input
   - Sign-up: Email, username, password, optional referral code
   - Sign-in: Email and password
   - Both validate input before submission

## Testing the Flow

1. **Unauthenticated User**:
   - Visits home page → sees "Get Started" and "Sign In" buttons
   - Clicks "Get Started" → navigates to `/auth/sign-up`
   - Fills form and submits → creates account
   - Redirected to `/auth/sign-up-success`
   - Clicks "Go to Sign In" → navigates to `/auth/sign-in`

2. **Sign In**:
   - Enters email and password
   - Submits → authenticated
   - Redirected to `/dashboard`

3. **Authenticated User**:
   - Visits home page → sees "Dashboard", "P2P Market", "Referrals", etc.
   - Can navigate to protected routes
   - Clicks "Sign Out" → logs out and redirected to home

## Environment Variables Required

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL` (for development)

All are automatically set up when Supabase integration is connected.
