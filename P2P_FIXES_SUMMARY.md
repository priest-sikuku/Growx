# P2P Trade Visibility Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Script Conflicts
- **Deleted script 019**: It was trying to modify `seller_id` column that no longer exists after script 020 recreated the table
- Script 020 already handles all the changes that script 019 was attempting

### 2. Trade Visibility Issue
The main problem was in the My Orders page where trades weren't displaying:

**Problem**: Incorrect Supabase join syntax
\`\`\`javascript
// ❌ This doesn't work in Supabase
.select(`
  *,
  buyer_profile:buyer_id (username),
  seller_profile:seller_id (username)
`)
\`\`\`

**Solution**: Fetch profiles separately and merge
\`\`\`javascript
// ✅ Fetch trades first
const { data: tradesData } = await supabase
  .from("trades")
  .select("*")
  .or(`buyer_id.eq.${user.id},seller_id.eq.${user.id}`)

// ✅ Then fetch profiles separately
const { data: profilesData } = await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .select("id, username, rating, total_trades")
  .in("id", userIds)

// ✅ Merge them together
const tradesWithProfiles = tradesData.map(trade => ({
  ...trade,
  buyer_profile: profilesData.find(p => p.id === trade.buyer_id),
  seller_profile: profilesData.find(p => p.id === trade.seller_id)
}))
\`\`\`

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added console.log statements with "[v0]" prefix to track:
- User authentication status
- Trades fetched from database
- Profile data merging
- Any errors that occur

## What Users Will See Now

1. **My Listings Tab**: Shows all their active, completed, and cancelled listings
2. **My Trades Tab**: Shows all trades they're involved in (as buyer or seller) with:
   - Trade amount and total price
   - Other party's username
   - Payment method
   - Trade status (pending, completed, cancelled)
   - Clickable to view full trade details

## Next Steps

If trades still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for "[v0]" logs to see what data is being fetched
2. Verify that script 026 has been run to add `price_per_coin` and `escrow_amount` columns to trades table
3. Ensure RLS policies allow users to see their own trades
